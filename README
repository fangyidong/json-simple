[DEVELOPERS]
Use settings similar to those included in:
eclipseCleanup.xml
eclipseFormatter.xml
eclipsePreferences.epf
elcipseTemplates.xml

Code sorting should follow this priority with no preference on visibility: Types > Static Initializers > Initializers > Static Fields > Fields > Constructors > Static Methods > Methods.

Generate json-simple project files for eclipse:
mvn eclipse:eclipse

Build the project:
mvn compile

Build the project with javadocs and source:
mvn package

Make the signed artifacts available to other local projects:
mvn clean install

Guided deploy of project with signed artifacts:
Automated source cleanup.
Update CHANGELOG.
Acquire release keys based on guidance from: https://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html
	gpg2 --full-gen-key
	gpg2 --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys KEYHASHTOSEND
Ensure the settings.xml file is present in the maven repostiory. For example: ~/.m2/settings.xml should have the contents:
<settings>
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>ossrh</id>
			<username>account_name_with_group_id_control_in_maven_central</username>
			<password>plain_text_password_so_ensure_file_has_restricted_permissions_and_access</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
